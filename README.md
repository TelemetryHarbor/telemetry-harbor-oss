# üìò Telemetry Harbor OSS

**Telemetry Harbor OSS** is the open-source ingestion and visualization stack behind [Telemetry Harbor](https://telemetryharbor.com).

It provides:

* **API ingestion layer** (Go Fiber) with Redis-backed queue
* **Worker** for insert into TimescaleDB
* **Grafana** with pre-configured dashboards and datasource
* **TimescaleDB** optimized for time-series telemetry
* **Redis** for queue management

With this stack, you can **self-host a full telemetry backend** and use the official [Telemetry Harbor SDKs](https://docs.telemetryharbor.com/docs/category/sdks). to push your data.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TelemetryHarbor/telemetry-harbor-oss.git
cd telemetry-harbor-oss
docker compose up -d
```

Once started:

* API available at ‚Üí `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`
* Grafana available at ‚Üí `http://localhost:3000` (default: `admin / StrongAdminPassword!`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

This repository ships with **default credentials** for ease of testing.
Before using in production, you **must change**:

* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `docker-compose.yml`
* `REDIS_PASSWORD` in `docker-compose.yml`
* `API_KEY` in `docker-compose.yml`
* `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `docker-compose.yml`

Failure to do so will leave your system vulnerable.

## üì° Ingestion API

Replace Telemetry Harbor Cloud URLs with your own domain omitting harbor id.

### Single Data Push

```http
POST https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/ingest/
```

### Batch Data Push

```http
POST https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/ingest/batch
```

Both require the **API key** set via environment variable (`API_KEY`).

---

## üìä Visualization

Grafana comes pre-configured with:

* **Telemetry Harbor Datasource** (TimescaleDB)
* **Telemetry Harbor Dashboard**

You can log into Grafana (`http://localhost:3000`) and start exploring your telemetry data immediately.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è SDKs

Telemetry Harbor OSS is compatible with the **[Telemetry Harbor SDKs](https://docs.telemetryharbor.com/docs/category/sdks)**:

* Python
* C++
* JavaScript
* Arduino / Espressif

Just replace your ingest endpoint with your OSS URL.
